# Expedition Tracker

Expedition tracker is a web-based expedition package tracking application. This application supports up to 10 types of expedition services in Indonesia such as JNE, POS Indonesia, etc.

But this is only for frontend, which means that this is only a display, where for processing receipt data tracking is on a separate project, which is called API. This application will not work if the API is closed, dead or the API used is not suitable.

You can take the API from the Expedition Tracker application at https://gitlab.com/ananmaneki77/expedition-tracker-backend
